    <li>Beat the eggs: in a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until 
      they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a flutter texture. </li>
    <li>Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and cold butter or oil. </li>
    <li>Cook the Omlette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to 
      ensure eggs evenly coat the surface</li>
    <li>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, 
      sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the Omelette. </li>
    <li>Fold and serve: As the Omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for
       another minutes, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
    <li>Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed. </li>
